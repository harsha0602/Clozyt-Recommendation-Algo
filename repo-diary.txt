# Repo Diary

We have accomplished the following so far:

- Added a `.gitignore` file tailored for a Next.js + React + TypeScript PWA project.
- Installed runtime and development dependencies for the PWA.
- Added initial source files and configurations for the project.
- Implemented the basic UI in TypeScript in `src/app/`, using Next.js (App Router) with React hooks for mock `Item` data and Tailwind CSS utility classes to structure the header and deck layout around the `SwipeDeck` component.
